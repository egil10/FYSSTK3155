## Project Description
This project explores the challenge of linear regression on Runges function, using OLS, Ridge and LASSO regression. In addition, we implement methods for gradient descent, and use resampling methods such as bootstrap and cross-validation to explore the bias-variance tradeoff.

## Required Packages
To install the required packages, run the following command in terminal: !pip install -r requirements.txt


## Descripton of Notebooks and Python Files
### Python Files: 
- **gradient_descent.py**: Implementation of the following gradient descent methods for Ridge, OLS and LASSO regression: Standard GD, GD with momentum, ADAGrad, RMSProp, ADAM.
- **OLS.py**: Contains function that returns closed-form OLS parameters.
- **plot_style.py**: Sets code style for entire project, ensuring that every plot has the same styling.
- **polynomial_features.py**: Contains a function that returns a polynomial feature matrix, used in linear regression. Can return feature matrices either with or without intercept column.
- **prepare_data.py**: Contains a function for preparing the data used in the project. Performs train-test split, defines the Runge function, etc.
- **Ridge.py**: Contains function that returns the closed-form Ridge parameters.
- **Runge.py**: Used for plotting the Runge function during the project.
- **Set_latex_params.py**: Configuration for matplotlib plots in latex-style format.
- **stochastic_gradient_descent.py**: Implementation of stochastic gradient descent functions for Ridge, OLS and LASSO regression. Standard GD, GD with momentum, ADAGrad, RMSProp, ADAM.
