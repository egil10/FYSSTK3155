    Fit an Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression model from scratch
    using the closed-form normal equation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    X_train : ndarray of shape (n_samples, n_features)
        Training input features (without bias term).
    y_train : ndarray of shape (n_samples,)
        Training target values.
    X_test : ndarray of shape (m_samples, n_features)
        Test input features (without bias term).
    y_test : ndarray of shape (m_samples,)
        Test target values.

    Returns
    -------
    beta_hat : ndarray of shape (n_features + 1,)
        Estimated regression coefficients (including intercept).
    y_pred : ndarray of shape (m_samples,)
        Predictions for the test data.
    metrics : dict
        Dictionary containing evaluation metrics:
        - "r2" : float, RÂ² score on the test set
        - "mse" : float, Mean Squared Error on the test set
