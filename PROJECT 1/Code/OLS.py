    Fit an Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression model from scratch

    Parameters
    ----------
    X_train : ndarray of shape (n_samples, n_features)
        Training input features (without bias term).
    y_train : ndarray of shape (n_samples,)
        Training target values.

        Test target values.

    Returns
    -------
    beta_hat : ndarray of shape (n_features + 1,)
        Estimated regression coefficients (including intercept).
    y_pred : ndarray of shape (m_samples,)
        Predictions for the test data.
